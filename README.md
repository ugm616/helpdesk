# Helpdesk Location Search

Originally created by makktu (mattku.github.io).

A simple, lightweight search application for finding rooms and departments in the UHCW Walsgrave building (hopefully more locations to be added).

No database, no server - just pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Fast, real-time search as you type
- Search by room number or department name (partial or full terms work)
- Mobile-friendly with card-style results
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Loads instantly, works offline
- Zero dependencies - no frameworks or libraries needed

## How It Works

The app uses a simple JSON file to store location data, making it extremely portable and easy to maintain. Just update the JSON file to update the search data - no database shenanigans or backend sorcery required.
